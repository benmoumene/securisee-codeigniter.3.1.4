## Clean and secured version from CodeIgniter

This is a cleaned up and secured version of CodeIgniter 3.1.4. The index.php file of the CodeIgniter instance has been moved to the public folder for security reasons. This version of CodeIgniter also comes with the Community Auth plugin pre installed. 

### Installation
Do some magic stuff ;)

Will be completed soon!

* Create mysql/mariadb database
* Run install.sql from the install_remove_after folder
* Replace database settings in /application/config/database.php
* Create baseurl in /application/config/config.php
* Fix an Encryption key via /Key_creator. An 128 bit key is recommended
* Put the key in the /application/config/config.php file (replace current line)
